# Program to calculate the ages of three players based on their total age

# Get input for the total age of the three players
total_age = int(input("Enter the total age of the three players:\n"))

# Let the age of players X and Y be 'a'
# The age of player Z will then be 'a + 10'
# Total age = a + a + (a + 10) = 3a + 10

# Calculate age of player X and Y
a = (total_age - 10) / 3

# Calculate ages of players
age_x = int(a)
age_y = int(a)
age_z = int(a + 10)

# Display the ages
print(age_x)
print(age_y)
print(age_z)
